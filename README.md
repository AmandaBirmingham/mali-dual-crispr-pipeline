This repository contains code for the automated implementation of the dual-CRISPR screen analysis pipeline developed by Amanda Birmingham and Roman Sasik of the Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics at the University of California, San Diego.  This pipeline has been custom-built to analyze results from the dual-CRISPR screening system set up by the lab of Dr. Prashant Mali (UCSD).

As of now, this code is still private.  Contact Amanda Birmingham (abirmingham@ucsd.edu) if you need to access it.
